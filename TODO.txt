I want to add a settings menu or something similar once I learn frontend
better, I may have to use something other than pygame at that point though idk.

A settings menu that has a selector that will highlight over what setting you're on.
You press enter to toggle between, maybe arrow keys or mouse to select which setting
enter or space should be the key to toggle for all settings

An option to slightly speed up/ slow down the gameplay would also be fun. maybe
1.25x and .75x (changeable via arrow keys)

If the speed up option is a thing, I may want to change how I randomize the
darth vaders' movement and make it so their x velocity is random isntead of
their y velocity

At some point an ice movement feature would be fun but that was tough.

Maybe an option for a username and a highscore type of thing? (high scores is a huge yes)
Option to change the profile of the player icon?
The difficulty would be in making sure the image is the right size to fit luke's hitbox
